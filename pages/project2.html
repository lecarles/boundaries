	<p>There are some places in this world where many people decide to settle in one specific area forming villages, 
	cities and sometimes even metropolises. But the bigger a city becomes, the more you can discover different cultures, 
	all trying to blossom in their own way while taking part in some sort of system. In this collection of people some are naturally 
	interested in the origins, traditions and beliefs of their fellow people, day by day, after all forming a common functioning society. 
	Unfortunately, not everybody has such a high curiosity about foreign cultures and often misunderstandings or prejudices 
	draw boundaries between people of different origins, taking part in different, seemingly uncombinable cultures. 
	In our project we wanted to find a place where one can have a look at one specific aspect of two different cultures. 
	In our case we did find a place where you can stand on a very specific spot seeing aspects of two cultures at the 
	same time while standing in the middle of a symbolic border.<br>
	Do you want to have a look for yourself ?<br>
	This is where you are right now:<br>

<h4><center><br>50.56'31.9"N 6.55'47.5"E<br></center></h4>

<p>
	Stop for a moment and have a look around, take some time to observe your environment for a bit. 
	Are you alone in this park? What kind of people are around you? What are they doing? 
	Why do people even gather here in first place? <br>
</p>

<p>
	It is mandatory for us humans to have spaces with some sort of nature around us, 
	ideally far enough from the happenings of a crowded city yet close enough to reach easily, so that we can relax,
	 enjoy and forget about the daily stresses that we get fed by our jobs, families and society itself. The life in a city happens, 
	 for the most time, on asphalt or in between concrete and often in such a fast pace, that we almost can't keep up.
	 Daily recurrent liabilities, performance pressure or simply the hunt for the next penny wears us out easily. 
	So why not take a walk, play a game of basketball or do some barbeque with family and friends right?
	 Thanks to thoughtful town planning spaces like these enable people from different cultural backgrounds to 
	 connect and pursue the same human demands!<br>

<p>From this viewpoint you should be able to see two representative buildings for two different cultures. 
	To the right you can see the tip of the steeple of the Protestant Church "Christuskirche" through the trees,
	 which stands for our Christian western culture while on the other side of the "Innerer Gr端ng端rtel" one of the minarets
	  of the new built Shia "DITIB Central Mosque" can be seen through the gap of the two big residential buildings,
	   which stands for the eastern Muslim culture.<br></p>

<img src="../img/mosque.JPG" /> 
<img src="../img/church.JPG" />

<p>Even though the main teachings of both religions practised in either culture are very similar, 
	there are still big boundaries, disagreements and even heavy conflicts between both of those cultures.<br><br></p>

<h4>Some things to think about:</h4>

<p>Try to answer these just for yourself<br></p>
<ul>
 	<li>How important is culture to you in 2018?</li>
 	<li>How big of a part does religion take within culture regarding to your perception?</li>
 	<li>How important is an understanding of each other's culture for getting along with each other?</li>
 	<li>Can you truly understand someone's views and opinions without understanding anything about their culture?</li>
 	<li>What can a city do about the cultural understanding between its citizens?</li>
 	<li>Is there something you could do to try and be more understanding or open to other people's way of life?</li>
 	<li>How can you help creating a better society in regards to cultural boundaries?</li>
 	<li>What do you wish your city would do for your culture?</li>
 	<li>What are common misunderstandings that you encounter because of your culture?</li>
</ul>
<p>Take what you have learned about, culture, the use of spaces in a city and yourself and just try to keep it 
	in mind when you hear about the opening of the "DITIB Central Mosque" on Saturday, the 29.09.2018 where turkish prime
	 minister Erdogan will be in attendance and there will be demonstrations and gatherings arguing for or against the "DITIB
	  Central Mosque".</p>

<p>Think about how spaces like the "Gr端ng端rtel" in Cologne could aid in bringing people from different cultures and ethnicities together.</p>
