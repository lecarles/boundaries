                <p>Now that you are in the middle of the bridge look at both sides! Do you see that the river divides old and new? <br>
                Now look behind you, do you see the trains? Did you know they are driving so slow because of the steep curve they have to take to get into the main station because the architect wanted the bridge to be a continuation of the cathedral? <br>
                Now look below you! Did you know that there is an underwater tunnel that crossed from one side to the other? 
                <br>Just take a few minutes and observe your surroundings take in what you can see!</p>
